\maketitle
I can reference things like this \cite{THands2014MNRAS} or pick another paper from the same year like this \cite{THands2014IAUS} or use these ludicrous ID strings \citep{2014MNRAS.445.2285D}. Incorrect references don't work, though: \cite{MBlobbyNEdmonds1990}, \cite{3123MNRAS.123.123D}. I can probably even guess how to cite one of Walter's papers \citep{WDehnen2000MNRAS} but it will only work if he is first author. I can get his review easily: \cite{DehnenRead2011}, or his paper with Hossam: \cite{DehnenHAly2012}. Or I can cite the same paper twice: \cite{THands2014MNRAS}.

We can also reference papers in different ways: \cite{rein2009A&A}, \cite{Swift2013ApJ}, because the citation finding algorithm gives us some breathing room. It shouldn't choke on weird, misformed things: \cite{MBlahMNRAS}, \cite{2012MNRAS}.
