================================================
ADSTeX is a utility that looks in LaTeX documents for citations, then searches the NASA ADS database for matching papers, and outputs a .bbl file with your completed bibliography in. It's super-super alpha right now (as of writing this I've done maybe 6 hours work on it), but you can try running it on the example.tex file to see what it does.
- You'll need python3.0 or above
- In the adstex directory, run 
> latex example
- Now run
> python3 adstex.py example
to generate a bibliographt
- Re run latex twice to generate a final document.

If you prefer to use BiBTex, adsTeX can generate a .bib file for you. Just run
adsTeX in this way:
> python3 adstex.py example bibtex
and it will generate a .bib file.

That's it for now. If using in your own document, either of the following citation styles will work:

\cite{ASurnameBSurname2015JRNL}
Where A is the first initial of Author A, B is the first initial of Author B, 2015 is the year and JRNL is the ADS abbreviation of the journal name (eg. MNRAS, ApJ)

\cite{2014MNRAS.445.2285D}
Where the number can be any one of the hugely long ADS IDs.

The format of bibliography items is currently provided in the file "customcitationformat". This is identical to the format documented on the ADS website here: http://doc.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/help_pages/customformat.html , so you can construct your own format with ease.
Have fun!
